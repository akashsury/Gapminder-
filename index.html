            This visualization tool is about displaying relationship between Life expectancy and GDP Per Capita of the people 
         in 4 continents which includes 200 countries and showing the transition of them for more than 200 years. The population
         of the countries are displayed by using the areas of the circles in the graph. Using the color code of the circles in 
         the graph, the continents which the countries belonged to can be identified. It will be difficult to plot the large number 
         of datasets like this without the help of visualization tool. In this project, dataset is stored in json file. The main
         idea of this relationship is clearly represented by visualization of how the countries(in this graph) moves from the state 
         of unhealthy and poor to the state of rich and healthy over a period of time.
